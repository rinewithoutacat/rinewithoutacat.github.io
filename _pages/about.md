Rine Vieth (they/them) is a researcher, educator, analyst, artist, and all-around curious person interested in law, governance, gender and religion. They are also beginning new research projects on 1) anti-gender mobilization and its impacts on asylum claims in Canada and the UK, as well as writing about 2) knowledge infrastructures in asylum systems. [Their usual homepage is here](https://rinevieth.com/).

If you're here, you probably are less interested in their more academic work and more interested in their community-oriented work. Or, maybe you—like them!—see the two as inseperable. Either way, this is where more of their coding, testing, and otherwise glitchy work lives.
